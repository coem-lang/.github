# Coem: A Poetic Programming Language

Welcome! This is the organisation for Coem, a poetic programming language.

## Overview

(I'll star the ones that are probably most interesting!)

[jcoem](https://github.com/coem-lang/jcoem) — I started the project here, following the course of Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). It's written in Java. It may be archived, since my intention is now to work primarily in JavaScript.

★ [jscoem](https://github.com/coem-lang/jscoem) — After mostly completing jcoem, I ported it over to JavaScript, following the example of [YALI.js](https://github.com/danman113/YALI.js) by Daniel Berezin (danman113). I am primarily working on this implementation.

★ [coem-editor](https://github.com/coem-lang/coem-editor) — This is the interactive web editor for the JavaScript implementation of Coem, using CodeMirror.

★ [lang-coem](https://github.com/coem-lang/lang-coem) — This is the Lezer grammar and language support for Coem, so CodeMirror can understand and do fancy things in Coem.

[coem-web](https://github.com/coem-lang/coem-web) — This is the rest of the Coem website, containing all the relevant information and documentation. It's written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
